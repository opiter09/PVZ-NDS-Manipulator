In the PVZ NDS google doc, the only thing found so far is data for plant cost and whatnot. I have found the area mentioned there among the split files, namely in
arm9.bin at address 0xE681C.

There and in the next three bytes are the Sun Cost for Peashooter, and then recharge, something unknown, and Action Rate, all as four-byte little-endian numbers. Then 
comes Sunflower's data, and so it goes in an order strikingly incongruous with the list of plant names that comes before this section.

Thanks to whoever made the PVZ NDS google doc for starting me on this journey.
